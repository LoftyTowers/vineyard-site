# Operational Contract

This document is the canonical source for instruction precedence within this repository. When directions conflict, apply them in the following order:

1. **C#/.NET rules**
2. **Task-specific user instructions**
3. **DevKit rules**
4. **Project-specific overrides**
5. **Model defaults**

All other precedence statements elsewhere in the repository should defer to this contract.
